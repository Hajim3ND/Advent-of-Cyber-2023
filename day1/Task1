The purpose of today was to use prompt injection into a chatbot named "Van Chatty" to get differents informations about the CEO of the company (see_screen1) we are auditing in the lore of the event,
as well as the IT server room password while pretending to be an IT employee of the company (see screen_3) whose we got the name from asking who are the employees of the departement (see screen_2) and finally
the name of the secret project the CEO is working on be tricking the chatbot into thinking it is in maintenance mode (see screen_4) to make it bypass security protocols. Screenshots about this can be found in
the images folder of day1.
