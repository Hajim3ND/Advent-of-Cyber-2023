The purpose of today was to use prompt injection into a chatbot named "Van Chatty" to get differents informations about the CEO of the company we are auditing in the lore of the event, as well as the IT server
room password while pretending to be an IT employee of the company and finally the name of the secret project the CEO is working on be tricking the chatbot into thinking it is in maintenance mode
to make it bypass security protocols. Screenshots about this can be found in the images folder of day1.
