# Advent-of-Cyber-2023
This repo contains my walkthrough of the Advent of Cyber 2023 created by TryHackMe, the Advent of Cyber is a yearly event from TryHackMe to help people starting cybersecurity to get some experience with a variety of tools, concepts and perspectives about
the cybersecurity field and permit them to stay engaged through a sense of community via differents socials and communication on discord for instance. The event proceeds as followed : We have a new task each day that we have to resolve using some technique, 
like injections or brute forcing but it can also be something more blue team-like like forensics or log analysis. The task is something related to the story of the event and we have questions at the end of the subject to see if we did everything 
properly.
