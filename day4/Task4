Today's task was to use CeWL to get the credentials of the company, we firstly had an introduction to the tool (see screenshot_1). We generated a wordlist for the website (see screenshot_2) that we saved to a text
file (see screenshot_3) as a basic introduction, then we used it to try to get passwords (see screenshot_4) and usernames (see screenshot_5) and finally with the help of the tool wfuzz, together with what we got
earlier we got the credentials of the website through this command (see screenshot_6), thereby we could connect to the website (see screenshot_7) which gave us the final flag.
