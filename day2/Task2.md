The objective of this task was to do a log analysis using data science and the python language with the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. We did it while using a Jupyter Notebook virtual machine, we started by 
doing a series to familiarize ourselves with Pandas and Python

then we did a DataFrame

after that we created a plot with Matplotlib

and that ends the first part of the task. For part 2, as we took the tools in hand we had to use them to gather information about a dataset called "network_traffic.csv".

The first thing to do was getting the number of Packet using the count function on the dataframe

then we had to see what IP had the highest amount of traffic by doing a groupby of the Source and Destination categories

and lastly we had to sort out what was the most frequent protocol with the use of the value.counts funtion
