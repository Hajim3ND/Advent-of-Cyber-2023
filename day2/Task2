The objective of this task was to do a log analysis using data science and the python language with the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. We did it while using a Jupyter Notebook virtual machine, we started by 
doing a series to familiarize ourselves with Pandas and Python (see p1_screenshot1) then we did a DataFrame (see p1_screenshot3) after that we created a plot with Matplotlib (see p1_screenshot4) and that ends the first 
part of the task. For part 2, as we took the tools in hand we had to use them to gather information about a dataset called "network_traffic.csv" (see p2_network_traffic). The first thing to do was getting the 
number of Packet using the count function on the dataframe (see p2_screenshot1) then we had to see what IP had the highest amount of traffic by doing a groupby of the Source and Destination categories
(see p2_screenshot2) and lastly we had to sort out what was the most frequent protocol with the use of the value.counts funtion (see p2_screenshot3.png). Screenshots mentioned can be found in the images folder of
day2.
